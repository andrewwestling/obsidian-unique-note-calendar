# ðŸ“’ Obsidian Unique Note Calendar

See your Obsidian [unique notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Unique+note+creator) on a calendar

## Development

For development, I use a symlink to this folder in my development vault.

To set up the symlink, I used this command:

```
ln -s ~/Code/obsidian-unique-note-calendar ~/o-vault-dev-unique-note-calendar/.obsidian/plugins/
```

This plugin supports [Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload).
